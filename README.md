# Restaurant Management System - OOP2 Final Project

This was the final project of the **Object-Oriented Programming 2 (OOP2)** course. It is a **Restaurant Management System** built using **.NET MAUI** and **Blazor**, showcasing OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and modular design. The system provides functionalities to manage orders, employees, menu items, and inventory while ensuring data persistence using SQLite.

## Authors
This project was collaboratively created by the following contributors:
- **Jacob Jobse**
- **Mostapha Alahmair**
- **Noah Jobse**

## Features
- **Order Management**: Create, track, and manage orders; view order history.
- **Employee Management**: Add, update, and delete employee records.
- **Inventory Management**: Update and monitor stock levels of menu items.
- **Menu Management**: Maintain and modify menu items, including descriptions and prices.
- **Dashboard**: A centralized interface for managing restaurant operations efficiently.

## Technical Highlights
- **OOP Concepts**:
  - **Encapsulation**: Database interactions and business logic are encapsulated in the `DatabaseHelper` class, ensuring clean and secure data access.
  - **Inheritance**: Extensible class design allows entities like `User` and `Order` to be reused and customized as needed.
  - **Modular Design**: Components are separated into reusable methods and classes, such as `MenuItem` and `Order`.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Built with .NET MAUI, the application runs natively on mobile and desktop platforms.
- **Data Persistence**: Utilizes SQLite for robust data management and local storage.
- **Blazor UI**: Provides a responsive and user-friendly interface with smooth navigation.

## Learning Outcomes
- Applied OOP principles to design and implement a scalable, maintainable application.
- Strengthened collaboration skills through effective teamwork and project management.
- Gained hands-on experience with modern frameworks like .NET MAUI and Blazor.
- Enhanced knowledge of database management and secure CRUD operations using SQLite.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Build the project to restore dependencies.
4. Run the application to initialize the SQLite database and access the system.

## Usage
- Use the dashboard to navigate through various operations.
- Manage employees, menu items, and orders using the respective modules.
- View order history and update inventory as needed.
